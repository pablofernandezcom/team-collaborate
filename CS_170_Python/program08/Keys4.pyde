Program Description
The canvas should be 800Ã—800 pixels.
The 'D' key causes the tree to grow by increasing the depth of recursion by 1, 'd' decreases the depth of recursion by 1.
The 'A' key increases the branch angle, 'a' decreases branch angle.
The 'L' key increases the length of the initial trunk, 'l' decreases it.
The 'S' key increases the scaling between successive levels of recursion, 's' decreases it.
Where important, conditionals should be employed to prevent user keystrokes from creating an illegal parameter value (i.e. the length should never be less than 1).
Build some kind of connection between the mouse and the tree.
Employ color.
In a separate copy of the program, implement some kind of Above & Beyond element.

# Download this script and save it in the folder containing the .png files.
# From a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the script and the
